        <p>My name is Opeyemi Idowu. Before starting this course with MIT, I graduated with a degree in Agricultural Economics and Farm Management. I love sciences, statistics, and history.
            As a kid, I loved playing action-packed video games. My other interests include traveling, hiking, swimming, camping and YouTube. With my certificate in Full Stack Development, I hope to start a career as a developer at a well-established company. 
            I also hope that this new career path would allow me to afford an even better life for myself and my family.
